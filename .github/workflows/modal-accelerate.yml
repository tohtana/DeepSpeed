# This CI is running on modal.com's GPUs.
#
# It's set up here on github actions and then the cloned repo is sent to modal and everything
# happens on their hw - see ci/accelerate.py for where the actual vm is loaded, updated and the tests are
# run.
#
# Both files are annotated to what's important and how one might change or update things if needed.
#
# Note that since this is a Required job we can't use `on.push.path` file filter - we are using
# collect-tests job to do the filtering for us so that the job can be skipped and satisfy the
# Required status for PRs to pass.
