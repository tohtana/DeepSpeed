#   infra   no GPU instance was provisioned; no candidate information, do nothing
#   timeout the run died at a time budget; open an issue
#   unknown no sentinel in the logs: the run died before the controller could
#           classify itself (checkout, setup, or a job kill); open an issue
#   report  real test failures; open an issue listing the failing tests
