"""Numerical parity between the DeepEP transport and the collective one.

Both backends move the same tokens to the same experts and reduce the same
weighted sum, so a step run through either must produce the same activations
and the same gradients. Only the route differs.

This is the test that catches a transport which silently drops something. The
routing weights were once handed to DeepEP's combine, which transports and
reduces them but does not multiply the rows by them, so expert outputs came
back summed but unweighted. Nothing raised, the loss still fell, and every
mock-level test still passed; only comparing the two paths' numbers exposes it.

Requires GPUs and a DeepEP build, so it is opt-in.
