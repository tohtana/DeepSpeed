AutoEP (Automatic Expert Parallelism)
=====================================

AutoEP automatically detects MoE layers in Hugging Face models and replaces them
with EP-enabled versions, requiring zero model code changes. It follows the
pattern of AutoTP (Automatic Tensor Parallelism).

This API is separate from the explicit ``deepspeed.moe.layer.MoE`` layer API.
For the explicit DeepSpeed MoE layer API, see :doc:`moe`.

**Built-in AutoEP presets:** ``mixtral`` (Mixtral), ``qwen3_moe`` (Qwen3-MoE),
``qwen3_5_moe`` (Qwen3.5-MoE), ``deepseek_v2`` (DeepSeek-V2), and
``deepseek_v3`` (DeepSeek-V3).

The preset name means AutoEP knows the router, expert, and weight naming
patterns for that model family. Running a Hugging Face model also requires a
Transformers build that exposes the matching config/model classes,
``model.config.model_type`` value, and fused expert layout.

.. list-table:: AutoEP preset compatibility by Transformers version
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Preset
     - Minimum Transformers version
     - Notes
   * - ``mixtral``
     - ``5.0.0``
     -
   * - ``qwen3_moe``
     - ``5.0.0``
     - Also covers Qwen2-MoE when the installed Transformers build uses the
       validated fused expert layout. Qwen3-MoE classes appear in ``4.51.3``,
       but the tested ``4.x`` builds do not match the validated AutoEP layout.
   * - ``qwen3_5_moe``
     - ``5.2.0``
     - Requires the Qwen3.5 text-backbone ``qwen3_5_moe_text`` model type;
       for performance on Qwen3.5's Gated DeltaNet layers, install optimized
       kernels. See the `Hugging Face Transformers kernel loading docs
       <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/kernel_doc/loading_kernels>`__
       and the `Qwen FlashQLA blog <https://qwen.ai/blog?id=flashqla>`__.
   * - ``deepseek_v2``
     - ``5.0.0``
     - ``load_balance_coeff`` / expert-bias auxiliary-loss-free load balancing
       is not currently supported; non-null values are rejected.
   * - ``deepseek_v3``
     - ``5.0.0``
     - ``load_balance_coeff`` / expert-bias auxiliary-loss-free load balancing
       is not currently supported; non-null values are rejected.

**ZeRO compatibility:** Stages 0, 1, and 2, plus constrained Stage 3
support. Stage 3 requires AutoEP-managed MoE layers and does not support native
DeepSpeed MoE layers, AutoTP, tensor model parallelism from ``mpu``, sequence
parallelism, MiCS, hpZeRO secondary tensor groups, non-1 expert tensor
parallelism, or quantized gradients. Stage 3 AutoEP checkpoints are saved
partition-natively in the ``zero_pp_rank_*`` shard files and support
same-topology load, module-only loads (``load_module_only``),
optimizer-state-free loads (``load_optimizer_states=False``), and Universal
Checkpoint conversion. Optimizer-including Universal Checkpoint loads can
resume with a different data-parallel world size, a different ``autoep_size``,
or both, when the target ``autoep_size`` divides the model's expert count.
Weights-only/module-only Universal Checkpoint loads use the converted
``fp32.pt`` parameter files and support the same data-parallel and
``autoep_size`` topology changes.

**Usage:**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "expert_parallel": {
            "enabled": true,
            "autoep_size": 4,
            "preset_model": "mixtral"
        }
    }

**How it works:**

1. During ``deepspeed.initialize()``, AutoEP scans the model for MoE layers
   using preset-defined patterns (router name, expert name, weight shapes).
2. Detected MoE blocks are replaced with ``AutoEPMoELayer``, which uses
   TorchTitan's grouped GEMM kernels and AllToAll token dispatch.
3. EP/EDP process groups are created automatically based on ``autoep_size``.
4. Expert parameters are marked for expert-data-parallel gradient reduction;
   router and shared-expert parameters use standard data-parallel reduction.

**Fused local token engine (experimental):**

``expert_parallel.local_token_backend`` selects how routed rows are moved around
the two expert all-to-alls. ``"eager"`` (default) keeps the existing
general-purpose tensor ops. ``"fused"`` replaces them with Triton kernels:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "expert_parallel": {
            "enabled": true,
            "autoep_size": 16,
            "preset_model": "qwen3_moe",
            "local_token_backend": "fused"
        }
    }

The fused engine groups rows by local expert, undoes that grouping, and applies
router scores while reducing over top-k. It reads and writes each row once, so
the padded copy of the token matrix, the zero-filled scatter buffer, and the
``[tokens, top_k, hidden]`` FP32 intermediate are never allocated. Routing
weights are still accumulated in FP32 and cast once, matching the eager result to
within the reduction order.

The collectives, the router and the grouped GEMM are untouched, so a measured
difference between the two backends belongs to the local token engine alone.

``"fused"`` is rejected, rather than quietly ignored, when it would have nothing
to replace or would change semantics:

- ``expert_tensor_parallel_size`` greater than 1, which restores combined tokens
  from assignment metadata instead of the weighted reduction;
- an explicit ``combine_impl="legacy_bmm"``, which selects the legacy reduction
  kept for model-family verification;
- a resolved ``score_apply`` other than ``"post"``;
- activations that are not bfloat16 or float16, a non-CUDA device, or a build
  without Triton.

Failing fast matters for measurement: a run that asked for ``"fused"`` and
silently got ``"eager"`` would report the difference between a backend and
itself.

**Constraints:**

- ``autoep_size`` must divide ``num_experts`` for all detected MoE layers.
- ``autoep_size=1`` is valid: all experts remain local (no AllToAll), useful
  for functional testing on a single GPU.
- AutoEP currently cannot be combined with AutoTP
  (``tensor_parallel.autotp_size > 1``) or tensor model parallelism from
  ``mpu``; support is planned as follow-up work.
- AutoEP with ZeRO Stage 3 is supported only without sequence parallelism,
  MiCS, hpZeRO secondary tensor groups, non-1 expert tensor parallelism, or
  quantized gradients.
- Regular checkpoint save/load requires matching ``autoep_size``. To change
  ``autoep_size`` or data-parallel world size across runs for the same
  AutoEP-detected model topology, convert the checkpoint to Universal
  Checkpoint format and load it with ``checkpoint.load_universal``; see the
  `Universal Checkpointing tutorial </tutorials/universal-checkpointing/>`__
  for the detailed flow and constraints.
- DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek-V3 AutoEP do not support load-balance expert bias
  yet. The built-in DeepSeek presets disable it by default; explicit non-null
  values fail.
